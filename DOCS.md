# DOCS

## Repository Findings

- The repo already contained a deployable Next.js App Router baseline with a landing page, a checkout success page, and placeholder webhook / cron routes.
- The previous planning layer was built around an earlier V1 decision set: plain SQL migrations as the primary schema contract, Postmark for email, and one paid monthly plan.
- The checked-in action library still lives under `data/action-library/` and remains a good fit for the approved V1 because it is already inspectable and exportable.
- The current product docs before this task conflicted with the approved stack and cadence requirements:
  - product brief assumed one paid plan
  - technical plan assumed Postmark instead of Resend
  - scheduler model assumed a single daily flow instead of daily + Monday weekly + monthly clarity replacement
- The public homepage copy in `app/page.tsx` also reflected the older one-price / Postmark direction and needed to be updated to avoid repo-level contradiction.
- The repo had no Prisma schema before this task.
- The repo had no inspectable TypeScript modules for plan mapping, cadence rules, tracking-link path generation, queue claiming, or action selection / adaptation rules before this task.

## Changes Made

- Rewrote `docs/one-thing-v1-technical-plan.md` into a concrete implementation blueprint for the approved V1 stack:
  - Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind on Vercel
  - Supabase Postgres + Supabase Auth
  - Prisma
  - Stripe Billing
  - Resend
  - Vercel Cron
- The new technical blueprint now covers:
  - folder structure
  - auth approach
  - onboarding flow wiring
  - Stripe mapping for three plans
  - webhook handling
  - daily / weekly / monthly email behavior
  - local-time 8:00 AM queue design
  - tracking-link endpoints for `Done` and `Pause`
  - action selection / adaptation structure
  - minimal account scope
  - export strategy
  - environment checklist
- Updated `docs/one-thing-mvp-brief.md` so the product brief no longer claims a single pricing plan and now reflects the separate Monday weekly email plus monthly clarity replacement behavior.
- Added `prisma/schema.prisma` as the new primary application schema contract.
- Replaced `db/migrations/0001_one_thing_v1.sql` so the SQL scaffold now matches the approved-stack design instead of the earlier single-daily / single-plan model.
- Added `lib/billing/plans.ts` with the concrete three-plan mapping:
  - `monthly`
  - `quarterly`
  - `annual`
- Added `lib/email/cadence.ts` with explicit cadence rules:
  - daily except on monthly clarity day
  - weekly on Monday
  - monthly clarity on day one of the month
  - weekly offset at `+10` minutes to remain separate on Monday mornings
- Added `lib/cron/send-queue.ts` with:
  - queue claim SQL
  - retry timing
  - dedupe key shape
  - future queue planning helpers
- Added `lib/actions/selection.ts` with pure TypeScript selection and adaptation logic for:
  - exact-repeat protection
  - fallback handling
  - texture variation
  - complexity targeting
  - `done` / `pause` streak evolution
- Added `lib/email/tracking-links.ts` so tracking-link path generation is explicit and centralized.
- Updated `.env.example` to reflect the approved runtime contract for Supabase, Prisma direct connections, Stripe three-price mapping, Resend, cron auth, and export auth.
- Updated `app/page.tsx` so the public landing copy now reflects the approved stack and cadence design rather than the deprecated one.
- Added `app/api/webhooks/resend/route.ts` as a placeholder for Resend event ingestion.
- Added `app/api/cron/process-send-queue/route.ts` as the canonical placeholder route matching the new queue design.
- Updated the existing placeholder cron and Stripe webhook routes so their scaffold messaging points at the new blueprint and support files.

## Verification Notes

- The repo still contains the older launch action library and checkout success surface; those remain compatible with the new blueprint and were left in place.
- No live billing products, Supabase configuration, or Resend configuration were changed in external systems during this task.
- `npm ci`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` completed successfully after the blueprint update.
- Commit, push, and deployment verification were still pending at the time these notes were written.
